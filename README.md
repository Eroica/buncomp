Bunnylin's Chromaticity Compressor
==================================

Now available at [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/bunnylin/buncomp/)!

This free and open-source program takes an image with lots of different
colors, and momentarily returns the image with far fewer colors, but
still looking almost as good.

The code is kind of a mess, since I wrote it about 10 years ago, but the
program still works fine and produces good-quality results.

Main site: [mooncore.eu/buncomp](https://mooncore.eu/buncomp/)

Target: [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/), for win32 only.

Depends: mccommon and mcgloder from [moonlibs](https://github.com/bunnylin/moonlibs)
